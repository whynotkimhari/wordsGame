# wordsGame
Let's concatenate words

- can save the game, if you want to continue playing your last, just type exact name of yours
- data: words.txt from [english-word](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) contains ~480k words
- txt -> json: using convert_to_json.py to convert .txt to .json format like {'a': [words start with 'a'], ...}
- ranks: [api](https://retool.com/api-generator/). I use this for learning using Fetch, API purposes
